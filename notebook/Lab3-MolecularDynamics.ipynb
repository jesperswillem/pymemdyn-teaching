    "In this practical, you will prepare and run molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor-ligand complex that you also looked at in Practical 1. MD simulations are a powerful computational tool used to study the behavior of (macro)molecules at the atomic level. Here, you will go through the steps required to prepare and run MD simulations using the PyMemDyn Python Package. Normally, these steps are all run at once, but here they are run individually to better understand what each step does and why they are needed for a successful MD simulation on a membrane protein.\n",
